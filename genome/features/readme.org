* Genome Features for Plasmodium Falciparum
** current:	2011-03-01
** strain:	3D7
** url:		ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Plasmodium/falciparum/3D7/3D7.latest_version/

** ./get.sh
*** get the database (GFF format for each chrom)
*** save to date directory
*** use featuresSchema.sql as schema 
*** call ./parse.pl to translate GFF to sqlite3 database

** Design Choices ( Sun Mar 20 12:42:23 EDT 2011 )
*** IGNORED fasta gene info included in gff
*** Produce only one table (rather than a table for genes, gaps, ncRNA, rRNA etc
**** all types can be viewed:
		cut -f3 -s 2011-03-20/* |sort |uniq -c
****  9 fields outlined in gff file by http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html
**** plus many more lumped into the last ('group') feild
	see featuresSchema.sql
***** Many of the fields are used by only one read and might be useless (e.g. clustalx_file, blastp_file)
*** stop_codon_redefined_as_selenocysteine is not given a value consistnatly
**** assume appears (which is very rare) indicates it is true
